            <h2>Ali Richomme</h2>
            <p>I was born in Jersey, Channel Islands and I grew up loving the sciences, music and art. 
                Since leaving the island in 2012 to go to the University of Bristol to study 
                Engineering Mathematics, I started programming and excelled in Data Modelling 
                and Analytics. Upon graduation with a first class honours masters degree, 
                I started work as a Data Scientist at a small Bristol-based company called
                Polecat Intelligence who primarily work with the risk and reputation of corporations. 
                After progressing through the ranks to Senior Data Scientist, I left Polecat in 2019
                to pursue my other passion; Travel. <br><br>

                Setting out on my first long-term solo-trip, I travelled from Mexico all the way
                through Latin America to Argentina. Towards the end of my time in South America, 
                I begun volunteering and helped run a hostel in Huanchaco, Peru. 
                COVID-19 saw an abrupt end to my travelling and I helped to set-up and run a charity
                which provided food to families in need during quarantine in Huanchaco. <br><br>
                
                I returned to Jersey in June 2020 and began working for Altair Partners as an 
                IT consultant.
